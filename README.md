# CMSC-350-Data-Structures
Projects 1 - 4

Project 1: The first programming project involves writing a program that evaluates infix expressions of unsigned integers using two stacks. The program should consist of three classes. The main class should create a GUI that allows the user input an infix expression and displays the result.


Project 2: The second programming project involves writing a program that accepts an arithmetic expression of unsigned integers in postfix notation and builds the arithmetic expression tree that represents that expression. From that tree, the corresponding fully parenthesized infix expression should be displayed and a file should be generated that contains the three address format instructions


Project 3: The third programming project involves writing a program that performs a sort by using a binary search tree. The program should be able to sort lists of integers or lists of fractions in either ascending or descending order. One set of radio buttons should be used to determine whether the lists contain integers or fractions and a second set should be used to specify the sort order.


Project 4: The fourth programming project involves writing a program that behaves like the Java command line compiler. Whenever we request that the Java compiler recompile a particular class, it not only recompiles that class but every other class that depends upon it, directly or indirectly, and in a particular order. To make the determination about which classes need recompilation, the Java compiler maintains a directed graph of class dependencies. Any relationship in a UML class diagram of a Java program such as inheritance relationships, composition relationships and aggregations relationships indicate a class dependency.
